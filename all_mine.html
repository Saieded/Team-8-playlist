    Yeah <br>
    It's all mine, yeah<br>
    Yeah, you know how it feels<br>
    Yeah<br>
    
    All mine, all mine, yeah<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine, yeah (It's all mine)<br>
    All mine, all mine, yeah<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine (It's all mine)<br>
    Baby, let's keep it real<br>
    
    We both still young, so what's the rush?<br>
    The night is young and we not drunk enough<br>
    You come around if I don't do too much<br>
    We had our downs but we had way more ups<br>
    Let's make love<br>
    That be the reason that you always hit me up (Ooh)<br>
    I swear, you like the way I fuck 'cause I gеt rough<br>
    You told me your new man don't make you nut, that's a damn shamе<br>
    You come here, I'll knock your pussy out the damn frame<br>
    Remember that last time I made you miss your damn plane?<br>
    Remember that last time I wet you down with champagne? (Remember that?)<br>
   
    I know that I've been the worst (Oh)<br>
    But I'll love you better (Ooh)<br>
    If you let me<br>
    Let's catch a flight, change the weather<br>
    And I promise forever<br>
    
    All mine, all mine, yeah<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine, yeah (It's all mine)<br>
    All mine, all mine, yeah (You know how it feels, you know how it feels)<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine, yeah (It's all mine)<br>
    All mine, all mine, yeah (You know how it feels)<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine, yeah (It's all mine)<br>
    All mine, all mine, yeah (To be mine, mine)<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine (It's all mine)<br>
    Baby, let's keep it real<br>
    
    If only I could pay the bills with my love for you (Ooh)<br>
    We'd be the richest in the fuckin' room<br>
    Ayy, we'd be so comfortable<br>
    Girl, it's only you for me, no lie, lie<br>
    I'll drop what they offered<br>
    They're not who I want them to be<br>
    That's not an offer to me<br>
    If you're around, baby<br>
    When you ain't with me, you feel alone (Alone)<br>
    And I was wonderin' if you've always known?<br>
    It don't have to be perfect, I feel like it's worth it<br>
    
    I know now that I've been the worst (Oh)<br>
    But I'll love you better (Ooh)<br>
    If you let me<br>
    Let's catch a flight, change the weather<br>
    And I promise forever<br>
    
    All mine, all mine, yeah<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine, yeah (It's all mine)<br>
    All mine, all mine, yeah (You know how it feels, you know how it feels)<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine, yeah (It's all mine)<br>
    All mine, all mine, yeah (You know how it feels)<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine, yeah (It's all mine)<br>
    All mine, all mine, yeah (To be mine, mine)<br>
    All mine, all mine, all mine (It's all mine)<br>
    Baby, let's keep it real <br> <br>
