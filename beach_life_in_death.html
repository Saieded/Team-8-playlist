   <center><font face="ink free regular" size="4">Last night I drove to Harper's Ferry and I thought about you <br>
    There were signs on the road that warned me of stop signs <br>
    The speed limit kept decreasing by ten <br>
    As we entered a town about halfway there <br>
    It was almost raining at the train station <br>
    We put our hoods on our heads at the train station <br>
    We threw rocks into the river <br>
    The river underneath the train tracks <br>
    And when the train came it was so big and powerful <br>
    When it came into the little station <br>
    I wanted to put my arms around it <br>
    But the conductor looked at me funny <br>
    So we had to say goodbye and leave <br>
    The monopoly board still in the backseat <br>
    Took that nightmare left turn to get out of town <br>
    Ran into the decreasing speed limits again <br>
    What should I do? Eat breakfast <br>
    What should I do? Eat lunch <br>
    What should I do? Eat dinner <br>
    What should I do? Go to bed <br>
    Where can I go? Go to the store <br>
    Where can I go? Apply for jobs <br>
    Where can I go? Go to a friend's <br>
    Where can I go? Go to bed <br>
    I wrote beach death when I thought you were taken <br>
    I wrote beach funeral when I knew you were taken <br>
    I wrote beach fags, well it wasn't about you <br>
    But it could've been. well no it couldn't have <br>
    I spent a week in Ocean City <br>
    And came back to find you were gone <br>
    I spent a week in Illinois <br>
    And came back to find you were still gone <br>
    I pretended I was drunk when I came out to my friends <br>
    I never came out to my friends <br>
    We were all on Skype <br>
    And I laughed and changed the subject <br>
    She said "what's with this dog motif" <br>
    I said <br>
    Do you have something against dogs? <br>
    I am almost completely soulless <br>
    I am incapable of being human <br>
    I am incapable of being inhuman <br>
    I am living uncontrollably <br>
    It should be anti-depression <br>
    As a friend of mine suggested <br>
    Because it's not the sadness that hurts you <br>
    It's the brain's reaction against it <br>
    It's not enough to love the unreal <br>
    I am inseparable from the impossible <br>
    I I want gravity to stop for me <br>
    My soul yearns for a fugitive from the laws of nature <br>
    I want a cut scene <br>
    I want a cut from your face to my face <br>
    I want a cut I want <br>
    The next related video <br>
    I don't want to go insane <br>
    I don't want to have schizophrenia <br>
    The ocean washed over your grave <br>
    The ocean washed over your grave <br>
    Ooooooh, ooooooh <br>
    Ooooooh, ooooooh <br>
    Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you <br>
    I woke up and I was trying to kill you <br>
    It's been a year since we first met <br>
    I don't know if we're boyfriends yet <br>
    Do you have any crimes that <br>
    We can use to pass the time I'm <br>
    Running out of drugs to try <br>
    We said we hated humans <br>
    We wanted to be humans <br>
    We said we hated humans <br>
    We wanted to be humans <br>
    Get more groceries, get eaten get more <br>
    Groceries, get eaten, get more groceries get eaten <br>
    Ooooooh, ooooooh <br>
    Ooooooh, ooooooh <br>
    A book of Aubrey Beardsley art corrupted me in youth <br>
    And now I'm trapped inside my youth <br>
    And you're in love with late-stage youth <br>
    Thank god for the little things and, and  <br>
    Fuck god that they're little things I am <br>
    Running out of prayers to sing and I <br>
    And pretty soon you'll find some nice young <br>
    Satanist with braces and one capital O significant Other <br>
    And you can take him home to your mother <br>
    And say, Ma, this is my brother <br>
    We said we hated humans <br>
    We wanted to be humans <br>
    We said we hated humans <br>
    We wanted to be humans <br>
    Get more groceries get eaten get more <br>
    Groceries get eaten get more groceries <br>
    Get eaten by the one you love <br>
    When they put their lips around you <br>
    You can feel their smile from the inside <br>
    Last night I dreamed he was trying to kill you <br>
    I woke up and I was trying to kill you <br>
    Your ears perked up <br>
    I perked up when your ears perked up <br>
    You were all looking around <br>
    And I hoped it was for me <br>
    I hoped you were using your sonar systems for me <br>
    The ancients saw it coming <br>
    You can see that they tried to warn them <br>
    In the tales that they told their children <br>
    But they fell out of their heads in the morning <br>
    They said sex can be frightening <br>
    But the children were not listening <br>
    And the children cut out everything <br>
    Except for the kissing and the singing <br>
    When they finally found their home <br>
    At Walt Disney studios <br>
    And then everyone grew up <br>
    With their fundamental schemas fucked  <br>
    But there are lots of fish left in the sea <br>
    There are lots of fish in business suits<br>
    That talk and walk on human feet<br>
    And visit doctors, have weak knees<br>
    Oh please let me join your cult<br>
    I'll paint my face in your colors<br>
    You had a real nice face<br>
    I had an early death<br>
    The ocean washed over your grave<br>
    The ocean washed open your grave<br>
    The ocean washed over your grave<br>
    The ocean washed open your grave<br>
    The ocean washed over your grave<br>
    The ocean washed open your grave<br>
    The ocean washed over your grave<br>
    The ocean washed open your grave<br>
    The ocean washed over your grave<br>
    The ocean washed open your grave<br>
    The ocean washed over your grave<br>
    The ocean washed open your grave</font></center> <br>
