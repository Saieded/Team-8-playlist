    Why do they gotta front? <br>
    What did we ever do to these guys<br>
    That made them so violent?<br>
    Woo-hoo<br>
    But you know I'm yours<br>
    Woo-hoo<br>
    And I know you're mine<br>
    Woo-hoo<br>
    (And that's for all time)<br>
    Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly<br>
    Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore<br>
    I don't care what they say about us anyway<br>
    I don't care about that<br>
    Don't you ever fear, I'm always near<br>
    I know that you need help<br>
    Your tongue is twisted, your eyes are slit<br>
    You need a guardian<br>
    Woo-hoo<br>
    And you know I'm yours<br>
    Woo-hoo<br>
    And I know you're mine<br>
    Woo-hoo<br>
    (And that's for all time)<br>
    Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly<br>
    Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore<br>
    I don't care what they say about us anyway<br>
    I don't care about that<br>
    I don't care about that<br>
    Bang, bang, a knock on the door<br>
    Another big bang and you're down on the floor<br>
    Oh no! What do we do?<br>
    Don't look now, but I lost my shoe<br>
    I can't run, and I can't kick<br>
    What's the matter babe, are you feeling sick?<br>
    What's the matter, what's the matter, what's the matter you?<br>
    What's the matter babe, are you feeling blue?<br>
    Ooh-wee-hoo, I look just like Buddy Holly<br>
    Oh-oh, and you're Mary Tyler Moore<br>
    I don't care what they say about us anyway<br>
    I don't care about that<br>
    I don't care about that<br>
    I don't care about that<br>
    I don't care about that<br> <br>
